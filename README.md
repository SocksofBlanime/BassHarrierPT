# BassHarrierPT

Bass Harrier is put together by having scrolling backgrounds coded to the main viewing camera as well as programmed moving parts of the board
The Floor board moves and lights up to the beat of the song playing on the stage
The player character is on a moving chain on the Z-axis with the element of 2D play. Up,left, right, and down(when applicable) are your directions of movement
Spacebar is to shoot the enemies 
This is a nonprofit project and is not to be sold or resold due to liscensing
